## Planned
- Create a function pipeline for 4 different concentration
- Account for 2 VOC mixtures in water, given certain concentration
- Given a type of VOC reuse the functions and components so it could calculate different concentrations easily
### 4 VOC species and 2 VOC in a single mix

- Basic functions of calculating concentration of voc in ppm in the headspace with given volume of VOC mixed in water
- Given a certain concentration and water volume calculate the amount of VOC in volume required
